            <h3> Why are cryptocurrencies so popular? </h3>
            <p> Cryptocurrencies appeal to their supporters for a variety of reasons. Here are some of the most popular: </p>

            <ul>
                <li> Some supporters like the fact that cryptocurrency removes central banks from managing the money supply, since over time these banks tend to reduce the value of money via inflation </li>
                <li> Other supporters like the technology behind cryptocurrencies, the blockchain, because it’s a decentralized processing and recording system and can be more secure than traditional payment systems</li>
                <li> Supporters see cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin as the currency of the future and are racing to buy them now, presumably before they become more valuable</li>
            </ul>
